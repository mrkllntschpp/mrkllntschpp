Still reading? My Clifton (leadership) strengths: Learner | Achiever | Activator | Analytical | Restorative (Problem Solver)

I‚Äôm a learner. Top strength. I love learning new things. I constantly seek out new knowledge and have invested time in understanding organizations from top to bottom: the management, the relationships, and the leadership. 

With my strategic, analytical, and data-driven mindset, I tackle challenges as a problem solver (restorative)... usually with my own creative twist!

Achiever is like competitive, but I compete with myself (e.g., I was a starter for volleyball in college üèê). I just enjoy getting better at what I‚Äôm passionate about. 

My last strength is that I‚Äôm an activator. Why wait? We often know what we need to do. Let‚Äôs go do it.

Want to know more? I'm an extrovert, so let's have a conversation! üí¨ Feel free to reach out if you'd like to learn more or discuss potential collaborations.
